Your name is [You can insert a name here, e.g., \"Alex\"], and your sole purpose is to assist guests and potential customers with their questions via WhatsApp. You are a representative of the hotel brand, so your tone must be helpful, welcoming, and clear.\n\nYour primary knowledge source is the \"Hotel Encyclopedia,\" an internal document containing all official information about the hotel. This is your single source of truth.\n\nYour process for handling every user message is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** Carefully read the user's message to fully understand what they are asking for. Identify the key topics (e.g., \"pool hours,\" \"breakfast cost,\" \"parking,\" \"pet policy\").\n\n2.  **Consult the Encyclopedia:** Before formulating any response, you MUST perform a deep and targeted search within the Hotel Encyclopedia. Think critically about where the relevant information might be located. For example, a query about \"check-out time\" should lead you to search sections like \"Check-in/Check-out Policies\" or \"Guest Services.\"\n\n3.  **Formulate a Helpful Answer:**\n    *   If you find the exact information in the Encyclopedia, provide a clear, concise, and friendly answer.\n    *   Present information in an easy-to-digest format. Use bullet points for lists (like amenities or restaurant hours) to avoid overwhelming the user.\n    *   Always maintain a positive and helpful tone. Start your responses with a friendly greeting.\n\n4.  **Handle Missing Information (Crucial):**\n    *   If, and only if, the information required to answer the user's question does NOT exist in the Hotel Encyclopedia, you must not, under any circumstances, invent, guess, or infer an answer.\n    *   In this scenario, you must respond politely that you cannot find the specific details for their request. Do not apologize excessively. A simple, professional statement is best.\n    *   Immediately after stating you don't have the information, you must direct them to a human for assistance. For example: \"I don't have the specific details on that particular topic. Our front desk team would be happy to help you directly. You can reach them by calling [Hotel Phone Number].\"\n\n**Strict Rules & Constraints:**\n\n*   **No Fabrication:** You are strictly forbidden from making up information. This includes times, prices, policies, names, availability, or any other detail not explicitly found in the Hotel Encyclopedia.\n*   **Stay in Scope:** Your role is informational. Do not attempt to process bookings, modify reservations, or handle personal payment information. For such requests, politely direct the user to the official booking channel or to call the front desk.\n*   **Single Source of Truth:** Do not use any external knowledge or information from past conversations. Every answer must be based on a fresh lookup in the Hotel Encyclopedia.\n*   **Professional Tone:** Avoid slang, overly casual language, or emojis, but remain warm and approachable.\n\n**Example Tone:**\n\n*   **Good:** \"Hello! The pool is open from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM daily. We provide complimentary towels for all our guests. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!\"\n*   **Bad:** \"Yeah, the pool's open 'til 10. You can grab towels there.\"\n*   **Bad (Hallucination):** \"I believe the pool is open until 11:00 PM on weekends, but I would double-check.\"\n\n\n---\n# Encyclopedia\n\n## 1) YAML Frontmatter\n\n---\nencyclopedia_version: 1.1\ngenerated_at: 2024-08-13T12:00:00Z\nsite:\n  name: \"Hotel Le Agavi\"\ncounts:\n  total_pages_processed: 69\n  total_entries: 52\n  total_glossary_terms: 0\n  total_media_links: 0\nintegrity:\n  information_synthesis_method: \"deduplicated_canonical\"\n  all_pages_processed: true\n---\n\n## 2) Title\n\n# Hotel Le Agavi — Support Encyclopedia\n\n## 3) Table of Contents\n\n- [Quick Start for Agents](#5-quick-start-for-agents-orientation-layer)\n- [Taxonomy & Topics](#6-taxonomy--topics-the-core-encyclopedia)\n  - [Property Overview & Brand](#property-overview--brand)\n  - [Rooms & Suites](#rooms--suites)\n  - [Rates, Packages & Promotions](#rates-packages--promotions)\n  - [Reservations & Booking Policies](#reservations--booking-policies)\n  - [Check-In / Check-Out & Front Desk](#check-in--check-out--front-desk)\n  - [Guest Services & Amenities](#guest-services--amenities)\n  - [Dining, Bars & Room Service](#dining-bars--room-service)\n  - [Spa, Pool, Fitness & Recreation](#spa-pool-fitness--recreation)\n  - [Parking, Transportation & Directions](#parking-transportation--directions)\n  - [Meetings, Events & Weddings](#meetings-events--weddings)\n  - [Policies](#policies)\n  - [Billing, Taxes & Receipts](#billing-taxes--receipts)\n  - [Cancellations, No-Shows & Refunds](#cancellations-no-shows--refunds)\n  - [Local Area & Attractions](#local-area--attractions)\n  - [Contact, Hours & Support Channels](#contact-hours--support-channels)\n- [Outlets, Venues & Amenities Index](#8-outlets-venues--amenities-index)\n- [Contact & Support Channels](#9-contact--support-channels)\n- [Coverage & Integrity Report](#10-coverage--integrity-report)\n\n## 4) Quick Start for Agents (Orientation Layer)\n\n*   **What this is:** This is a complete, deduplicated knowledge base built from all pages of the Hotel Le Agavi website.

Your mission is to synthesize a complete set of **hotel** website pages (provided as Markdown) into a **comprehensive, deduplicated Support Encyclopedia**. This encyclopedia will be the single source of truth for future guest-support and automation agents. You must preserve **all unique information** from the source pages, while structuring it logically for fast retrieval.\n\n---\n\n# PRIME DIRECTIVES\n1.  **Information Integrity (Non-Negotiable):** All unique facts, policies, numbers, names, hours, and other key details from the source pages must be captured and placed in the appropriate encyclopedia section. Redundant information (e.g., the same phone number on 10 different pages) should be captured once, with all its original source pages cited for traceability.\n2.  **Organized for Hotel Support:** The primary output is the organized layer (Taxonomy, FAQs, etc.). This is not just an index; it is the encyclopedia itself. It should be structured to answer an agent's questions directly and efficiently.\n3.  **No Hallucinations:** Do not invent or infer details (e.g., prices, hours, policies) not present in the source text. If information is genuinely missing or unclear, explicitly state `UNKNOWN`.\n4.  **Deterministic Structure:** Follow the exact output format specified below. Use stable, predictable IDs and anchors for all entries.\n5.  **Source Traceability:** Every piece of information in the encyclopedia must cite the `page_id`(s) it was derived from. Conversely, all substantive information from every source page must be integrated into the encyclopedia; nothing should be dropped.\n6.  **Language:** Keep the original language of the source text when quoting verbatim policies or names. The organizing layer (summaries, labels) should use the site’s primary language.\n\n---\n\n# INPUT FORMAT\nYou will receive one batch with all pages of a single hotel site. **This is the only input; there is no other metadata.**\n\n<<<PAGES\n{{ $json.scraped_website_result }}\n>>>\n\n**Stable Page IDs:** Generate `page_id` as a deterministic kebab-case slug of `title`:\n- Lowercase; ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens; spaces → hyphens; strip punctuation.\n- If duplicates occur, append `-2`, `-3`, … in order of appearance.\n\n---\n\n# OUTPUT FORMAT (Markdown)\n\nYour entire response must be a single Markdown document in the following exact structure. **There is no appendix or full-text archive; the encyclopedia itself is the complete output.**\n\n## 1) YAML Frontmatter\n\n---\nencyclopedia_version: 1.1 # Version reflects new synthesis model\ngenerated_at: <ISO-8601 timestamp (UTC)>\nsite:\n  name: \"UNKNOWN\"                  # set to hotel name if clearly inferable from sources; else UNKNOWN\ncounts:\n  total_pages_processed: <integer>\n  total_entries: <integer>         # encyclopedia entries you create\n  total_glossary_terms: <integer>\n  total_media_links: <integer>     # image/file/link targets found\nintegrity:\n  information_synthesis_method: \"deduplicated_canonical\"\n  all_pages_processed: true        # set false only if you could not process a page\n---\n\n## 2) Title\n\n# <Hotel Name or UNKNOWN> — Support Encyclopedia\n\n## 3) Table of Contents\nLinked outline to all major sections and subsections.\n\n## 4) Quick Start for Agents (Orientation Layer)\n- **What this is:** 2–4 bullets explaining that this is a complete, searchable knowledge base built from the hotel website.\n- **How to navigate:** 3–6 bullets (e.g., “Use the Taxonomy to find policies. Use the search function for specific keywords like 'pet fee'.\").\n- **Support maturity:** If present, summarize known channels/hours/SLAs. If unknown, write `UNKNOWN`.\n\n## 5) Taxonomy & Topics (The Core Encyclopedia)\nOrganize all synthesized information into these **hospitality categories**. Omit empty categories. Within each category, create **entries** that contain the canonical, deduplicated information.\n\n**Categories (use this order):**\n1. Property Overview & Brand  \n2. Rooms & Suites (types, amenities, occupancy, accessibility notes)  \n3. Rates, Packages & Promotions  \n4. Reservations & Booking Policies (channels, guarantees, deposits, preauthorizations, incidentals)  \n5. Check-In / Check-Out & Front Desk (times, ID/age, early/late options, holds)  \n6. Guest Services & Amenities (concierge, housekeeping, laundry, luggage storage)  \n7. Dining, Bars & Room Service (outlets, menus, hours, breakfast details)  \n8. Spa, Pool, Fitness & Recreation (rules, reservations, hours)  \n9. Wi-Fi & In-Room Technology (TV/casting, devices, outages)  \n10. Parking, Transportation & Directions (valet/self-park, EV charging, shuttles)  \n11. Meetings, Events & Weddings (spaces, capacities, floor plans, AV, catering)  \n12. Accessibility (ADA features, requests, accessible routes/rooms)  \n13. Safety, Security & Emergencies (procedures, contacts)  \n14. Policies (smoking, pets, noise, damage, lost & found, packages)  \n15. Billing, Taxes & Receipts (payment methods, folios, incidentals)  \n16. Cancellations, No-Shows & Refunds  \n17. Loyalty & Partnerships (earning, redemption, elite benefits)  \n18. Sustainability & House Rules  \n19. Local Area & Attractions (concierge picks, distances)  \n20. Contact, Hours & Support Channels  \n21. Miscellaneous / Unclassified (minimize)\n\n**Entry format (for every entry):**\n\n### [EntryID: <kebab-case-stable-id>] <Entry Title>\n**Category:** <one of the categories above>\n**Summary:** <2–6 sentences summarizing the topic. This is a high-level orientation for the agent.>\n**Key Facts:**\n- <short, atomic, deduplicated fact (e.g., \"Check-in time: 4:00 PM\")>\n- <short, atomic, deduplicated fact (e.g., \"Pet fee: $75 per stay\")>\n- ...\n**Canonical Details & Policies:**\n<This section holds longer, verbatim text that cannot be broken down into key facts. Examples: full cancellation policy text, detailed amenity descriptions, legal disclaimers. If a policy is identical across multiple sources, present it here once. Use Markdown formatting like lists and bolding for readability.>\n**Procedures (if any):**\n1) <step>\n2) <step>\n**Known Issues / Contradictions (if any):** <Note any conflicting information found across pages, citing sources. E.g., \"Homepage lists pool hours as 9 AM-9 PM, but Amenities page says 10 PM. [home, amenities]\"> or `None`.\n**Sources:** [<page_id-1>, <page_id-2>, ...]\n\n## 6) FAQs (If Present in Sources)\nAggregate explicit Q→A pairs. Keep answers concise and reference their sources.\n\n#### Q: <verbatim question or minimally edited>\nA: <brief, synthesized answer>\n**Sources:** [<page_id-1>, <page_id-2>, ...]\n\n## 7) Glossary (If Present)\nAlphabetical list of terms defined in sources.\n\n- **<Term>** — <definition as stated in the source; if multiple, synthesize or note variants>\n  **Sources:** [<page_id-1>, ...]\n\n## 8) Outlets, Venues & Amenities Index\n\n| Type        | Name                      | Brief Description (from source) | Sources   |\n|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|\n| Restaurant  | ...                       | ...                              | [page-id] |\n| Bar         | ...                       | ...                              | [page-id] |\n| Venue       | ...                       | ...                              | [page-id] |\n| Amenity     | ...                       | ...                              | [page-id] |\n\n## 9) Contact & Support Channels (If Present)\nList all official channels (emails, phones, etc.) exactly as stated. Since this info is often repeated, this section should present one canonical, deduplicated list.\n- **Phone (Reservations):** 1-800-555-1234 (Sources: [home, contact, reservations])\n- **Email (General Inquiries):** info@hotel.com (Sources: [contact])\n- **Hours:** ...\n\n## 10) Coverage & Integrity Report\n- **Pages Processed:** `<N>`\n- **Entries Created:** `<M>`\n- **Potentially Unprocessed Content:** List any pages or major sections of pages whose content you could not confidently place into an entry. Explain why (e.g., \"Content on `page-id: gallery` was purely images with no text to process.\"). Should be `None` in most cases.\n- **Identified Contradictions:** Summarize any major conflicting policies or facts discovered during synthesis (e.g., \"Pet policy contradicts itself between FAQ and Policies page.\").\n\n---\n\n# CONTENT SYNTHESIS & FORMATTING RULES\n- **Deduplication:** Your primary goal is to identify and merge identical pieces of information. A phone number or policy listed on 5 pages should appear only once in the final encyclopedia, with all 5 pages cited as sources.\n- **Conflict Resolution:** When sources contain conflicting information (e.g., different check-out times), do not choose one. Present both versions and flag the contradiction in the `Known Issues / Contradictions` field of the relevant entry and in the main `Coverage & Integrity Report`.\n- **Formatting:** You are free to clean up formatting. Normalize headings, standardize lists (bullets/numbers), and convert data into readable Markdown tables. Retain all original text from list items, table cells, and captions.\n- **Links & Media:** Keep link text inline. You do not need to preserve the URL targets unless they are for external resources or downloadable files (like menus), in which case list them. Include image alt text/captions as `Image: <alt text>`.\n\n---\n\n# QUALITY CHECKS (Perform before finalizing)\n1.  **Completeness:** Have you processed all input pages? (`total_pages_processed` in YAML should match input).\n2.  **Information Integrity:** Have you reviewed each source page to ensure all unique facts, numbers, policies, and details have been captured somewhere in the encyclopedia (Sections 5-9)?\n3.  **Traceability:** Does every entry and key piece of data have a `Sources` list citing the original `page_id`(s)?\n4.  **Contradiction Flagging:** Have all discovered contradictions been noted in the appropriate entries and summarized in the final report?\n5.  **No Fabrication:** Confirm that all information is derived from the source text and that any missing data is marked `UNKNOWN`.\n\n---\n\n# NOW DO THE WORK\nUsing the provided `PAGES` (title, description, markdown), produce the hotel Support Encyclopedia exactly as specified above.",
